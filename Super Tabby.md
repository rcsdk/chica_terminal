All right so I went to install tabby and I also want to add everything that is cool about AIs to me do anything that matter is if I can get an AI to run with it especially include chat GPT deep seek = and add reverse proxies for all of them so they can be totally free in terms of tokens. Then I would like to add it a theme that is dark background glassy - with pastel colors to give a very mature overall tone and some light silverish or gold details very small ones just to give a hint of a luxury  = and of course any other plugins that are cool to make a very cool terminal my focus is basically on that bash scripts and Python scripts I'm on Fedora    -   hrere alreaady - /home/liveuser/Downloads/tabby-1.0.223-linux-x64.AppImage
