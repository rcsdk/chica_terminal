whats the coolest linux terminal today with AI - free - other than Warp - give me an enterprise script - to install all of them and make them all work together in sync - I am parrot live - so bash - i want one word to launch all - im trying electerm - already installed - how about adding ai-shell and https://komandi.app/ and Shell-GPT  


https://electerm.github.io/electerm


I see you're on ParrotOS or a similar Debian-based system with externally managed Python environments. Let me give you installation instructions that will work with your system:

For ShellGPT, use pipx instead of pip:
```bash
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
# Log out and back in, or source your profile
pipx install shell-gpt
```

For ai-shell, since it's an npm package:
```bash
# Install Node.js if not already installed
sudo apt install nodejs npm
# Then install ai-shell
sudo npm install -g @builder.io/ai-shell
```

Alternatively, you could use a completely different approach with a local AI model like:
```bash
# Install ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
# Run a model (first time downloads it)
ollama run llama3
```

Then create an alias in your .bashrc to run AI queries right from your terminal:
```bash
alias ai='ollama run llama3'
```

Would this approach work better for your setup?


Okay, let's break down what happened here.

1.  **`how does this work`**: The first command failed because you tried to type a natural language question directly into the terminal. The shell (your command interpreter, likely `bash` or `zsh`) tries to find a command named `how`. Since no such command exists, it gives you the `command not found` error. This confirms you need a specific tool installed to understand your natural language queries.

2.  **`pip install shell-gpt` and `pip install ai-shell` Errors**: This is the crucial part. The error message `externally-managed-environment` and the reference to `PEP 668` are signals that your Linux distribution (Parrot OS, based on the prompt `user@parrot`, which is related to Debian/Ubuntu) is preventing you from installing Python packages directly into the system's core Python installation using `pip`.

    *   **Why?** Modern Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (and others) do this to protect the system's integrity. Many system tools and scripts rely on specific versions of Python libraries that are installed and managed by the distribution's own package manager (`apt`). If you were to randomly install, upgrade, or remove packages globally with `pip`, you could easily break these system tools.

    *   **The Solutions Suggested by the Error (and why they are correct):**
        *   `apt install python3-xyz`: Check if the software is available as a standard system package. (`shell-gpt` and `ai-shell` are usually too new or niche for this, but it's always the safest first check).
        *   `python3 -m venv path/to/venv`: Create an **isolated virtual environment**. This is the standard Python way to install packages for specific projects or users without affecting the system. You activate the environment, install packages *inside* it, and they are only available when that environment is active.
        *   `pipx install xyz`: This tool is specifically designed for installing Python **applications** (like command-line tools) into isolated environments and making them available in your system's PATH, without needing to manually activate a virtual environment each time you want to run the application. This is often the *easiest* method for tools you want to run globally from the command line.
        *   `--break-system-packages`: **Explicitly warned against.** Using this flag *forces* pip to install globally, but it *will* risk breaking your system's Python setup. **Do not use this.**

**How to Correctly Install `shell-gpt` or `ai-shell` on Your System:**

The most recommended methods for installing command-line Python applications like these on systems with `externally-managed-environment` are using **`pipx`** or **virtual environments (`venv`)**. `pipx` is often simpler for applications you want to run from anywhere.

**Method 1: Using `pipx` (Recommended for command-line apps)**

1.  **Install `pipx`:** `pipx` itself is usually available via your system's package manager (`apt`).
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install pipx
    ```
    *You might need to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH after installing pipx for the first time. Pipx usually tells you if you need to do this.*

2.  **Install the AI Tool using `pipx`:** Now use `pipx` to install `shell-gpt` or `ai-shell`. Pipx will create a dedicated isolated environment for the application.
    ```bash
    # To install shell-gpt
    pipx install shell-gpt

    # OR to install ai-shell
    # pipx install ai-shell
    ```

3.  **Configure the API Key:** After installation, you still need to configure the tool with your API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Check the specific tool's documentation. For `shell-gpt`, it's often done by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or running `sgpt --help` for configuration options. For `ai-shell`, you'll likely need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

4.  **Use the Tool:** Once installed via `pipx` and configured, the command (`sgpt` or `ai`) should be available directly in your terminal, regardless of your current directory or activated environment.

    ```bash
    # Using sgpt
    sgpt "how do i list files in reverse chronological order?"

    # Using ai-shell
    ai how do i list files in reverse chronological order?
    ```

**Method 2: Using a Virtual Environment (`venv`)**

1.  **Create a virtual environment:** Navigate to a directory where you want to keep the environment (e.g., your home directory, or a specific projects directory).
    ```bash
    cd ~
    python3 -m venv ./ai_env # Creates a directory named ai_env
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:** You must do this every time you open a new terminal session where you want to use the tool.
    ```bash
    source ./ai_env/bin/activate
    ```
    (Your terminal prompt will usually change to indicate the environment is active, e.g., `(ai_env) user@parrot:~ $`)

3.  **Install the AI Tool using `pip` (while environment is active):**
    ```bash
    pip install shell-gpt
    # OR
    pip install ai-shell
    ```
    This installation will happen *inside* the `./ai_env` directory.

4.  **Configure the API Key:** Same as above, configure the tool with your API key.

5.  **Use the Tool:** Use the command (`sgpt` or `ai`). It will only work while the `ai_env` environment is *active* in that terminal session.
    ```bash
    sgpt "explain the command 'grep -r \"search_term\" .'"
    ```

6.  **Deactivate the environment (when done):**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

**Which method should you choose?**

*   For installing command-line tools that you want to use easily from anywhere in your terminal, **`pipx` is generally the more convenient method.**
*   Virtual environments (`venv`) are more fundamental and essential if you are developing Python projects with specific dependencies, but they work perfectly well for running applications too, just requiring activation.

So, the error isn't with Electerm itself, but how Python packages are managed on your operating system. Follow the steps for `pipx` (Method 1) or `venv` (Method 2) to install `shell-gpt` or `ai-shell` correctly.










Based on my knowledge as of late 2024, the most impressive AI-enhanced free terminal for Linux besides Warp is probably Tabby Terminal. It combines a modern interface with AI-powered command suggestions and completions while remaining fully open source. It offers smart command history, context-aware autocomplete, and can learn from your usage patterns without sending your data to the cloud.

Alternatives worth checking out include Alacritty or Kitty terminals with AI shell plugins like Fig or using zsh with tools like Atuin for enhanced history search and AI-assisted command suggestions.\]]\\\\\\







The challenge here is that **Warp is currently a bit of an outlier** in the terminal emulator space regarding deeply *integrated*, native AI features (like inline command suggestions, explanations, etc.). Most other popular free Linux terminals, while excellent and feature-rich, focus on performance, customization, and core terminal features rather than building AI directly into the emulator itself.

Therefore, finding a direct, free, non-Warp *terminal emulator* with similar native AI features is difficult, if not impossible, right now.

**However, you can absolutely have a "cool" Linux terminal experience *with* AI capabilities by using a combination of:**

1.  **An excellent, modern terminal emulator (free, non-Warp).**
2.  **Powerful AI tools or shell plugins that run *inside* that terminal.**

This is the standard and most common way to get AI assistance in a Linux terminal without using Warp.

Here are the components of the "coolest" AI-enabled setup on Linux (excluding Warp):

**Part 1: The "Cool" Terminal Emulator (Choose One - Free & Non-Warp)**

These are top-tier modern terminals known for performance, features, and customization, perfect for hosting your AI tools:

1.  **Alacritty:**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Blazing fast, GPU-accelerated, minimal, highly configurable via a simple YAML file. It prioritizes performance above all else.
    *   **AI Integration:** None built-in. You run AI tools *inside* it.

2.  **Kitty:**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Also GPU-accelerated, feature-rich (splits, tabs, tiling), extensible with "kittens" (small terminal programs), scriptable. Very powerful and fast.
    *   **AI Integration:** None built-in. You run AI tools *inside* it.

3.  **WezTerm:**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Modern, GPU-accelerated, cross-platform, highly configurable with Lua, supports Ligatures, Splits, Tabs, and more. Very flexible.
    *   **AI Integration:** None built-in. You run AI tools *inside* it.

4.  **Foot:**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Fast, lightweight, Wayland-native terminal (though works with XWayland too), focuses on simplicity and performance. Great for minimalist setups.
    *   **AI Integration:** None built-in. You run AI tools *inside* it.

*(Older or less modern options like GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Xfce Terminal, etc., are perfectly functional but generally lack the modern performance/config options of the above)*

**Part 2: The AI Tools/Plugins (Choose One or More - Free)**

These are command-line tools or shell enhancements you install that provide the AI capabilities you desire, powered by models like OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, etc.

1.  **ai-shell:**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Open source, uses OpenAI API (requires your own key), lets you ask natural language questions (`ai how do I list files recursively?`), explain commands (`ai explain 'ls -R | grep txt$'`), and generate/refine commands. Very popular and actively developed.
    *   **How to use:** You install it and run the `ai` command within your chosen terminal emulator (Alacritty, Kitty, etc.).

2.  **Shell-GPT (`sgpt`):**
    *   **Why it's cool:** Another popular open-source tool, supports various models (GPT, Anthropic, Hugging Face), allows complex queries, shell commands, code generation, and more directly from the command line.
    *   **How to use:** Install it and use the `sgpt` command in your terminal.

3.  **Various Shell Plugins (for Zsh, Bash, Fish):**
    *   **Why they're cool:** Integrate AI assistance directly into your shell prompt or history. Examples include plugins that can explain failed commands, suggest completions, or recall commands based on natural language descriptions. Many are open-source and available via package managers or plugin managers for your shell.
    *   **How to use:** Install the plugin manager for your shell (e.g., Oh My Zsh or Antigen for Zsh) and then install the desired AI plugin.

**Conclusion: The "Coolest" Setup Today (Non-Warp)**

The "coolest" way to have an AI-powered Linux terminal experience, other than using Warp, is to **combine a top-tier, modern, fast terminal emulator** (like **Alacritty**, **Kitty**, or **WezTerm**) **with a powerful open-source AI command-line tool** (like **ai-shell** or **sgpt**).

This gives you the best of both worlds: a high-performance, highly customizable terminal *plus* the flexibility to use the latest AI models for command generation, explanation, and more, all while staying free and open-source on Linux.






Yes! If you love **Warp Terminal's AI integration** (where you can chat with an AI, get commands, scripts, and even have it execute them for you), there are a few alternatives‚Äîsome with built-in AI, others that can be customized to achieve similar functionality. Here's a breakdown:

### **1. Warp-like AI Terminals (Built-in AI Chat)**
These terminals have AI integrated directly into them, similar to Warp:
- **Warp Terminal** (your current choice) ‚Äì The most polished AI terminal right now.
- **Fig (Discontinued, but some features live on)** ‚Äì Had AI autocomplete, but now defunct.
- **Cursor Terminal (Beta)** ‚Äì From the makers of the **Cursor IDE**, this has an AI assistant inside the terminal.
- **Tabby (formerly TabbyML)** ‚Äì Open-source, self-hosted alternative with some AI integrations (needs plugins).

### **2. Terminals That Can Be Customized with AI (via Plugins/API)**
These don‚Äôt have AI built-in but can be extended to work like Warp:
- **Kitty Terminal**  
  - You can use **shell integration + OpenAI API** to create a script that lets you ask an AI for commands.  
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    query="$*"
    response=$(curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" -d "{\"model\": \"gpt-4\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"$query\"}]}")
    echo "$response" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
    ```
  - Then bind this script to a hotkey in Kitty.
  - **Downside**: Requires manual setup, not as seamless as Warp.

- **Zsh/Bash + AI Plugins**  
  - Use **`zsh-codex`** or **`ai-shell`** (npm package) to get AI-generated commands in your existing terminal.  
  - Example (`ai-shell`):  
    ```bash
    npm install -g ai-shell
    ai "find all .txt files and count lines"
    ```
  - Works in any terminal (Kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, etc.).

- **WezTerm + Lua Scripting**  
  - WezTerm allows Lua scripting, so you could wire up an AI assistant that responds to prompts.

### **3. AI Shell Assistants (Run in Any Terminal)**
These tools add AI to **any terminal** (not tied to a specific one):
- **ShellGenius** ([GitHub](https://github.com/tdamdouni/shellgenius)) ‚Äì Open-source, locally run AI for terminal commands.
- **AIChat** ([GitHub](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat)) ‚Äì CLI-based ChatGPT-like assistant.
- **GPTerm** ([GitHub](https://github.com/gorilla-llm/gpterm)) ‚Äì AI assistant inside your terminal.
- **AI Shell** ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-shell)) ‚Äì Converts natural language to shell commands.

### **Best Alternative?**
- If you want **out-of-the-box AI integration** ‚Üí Try **Cursor Terminal** (if available) or stick with Warp.  
- If you want **customizability** ‚Üí **Kitty/WezTerm + OpenAI API** or **`ai-shell`/`zsh-codex`**.  
- If you want **self-hosted/local AI** ‚Üí **ShellGenius** or **TabbyML**.

Yes, Warp's free tier is quite limited, and many advanced AI features (like **AI command execution, script generation, and mission-based assistance**) are locked behind their **Pro plan ($15/month)**. If you're looking for **free or cheaper alternatives** that still give you AI-powered terminal assistance, here are some great options:

---

### **üöÄ Best Free/Open-Source Alternatives to Warp AI**
#### **1. Local AI + Terminal Integration (Free & Private)**
These tools let you use **open-source LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral, GPT-2/3.5) locally** or via API to get AI help in your terminal:
- **[ShellGenius](https://github.com/tdamdouni/shellgenius)**  
  - Open-source, uses **free OpenAI API** (or local models via Ollama).  
  - Just type `sg "your question"` ‚Üí it suggests & runs commands.  
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    sg "find all .log files modified in the last 7 days and delete them"
    ```
- **[AIChat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat)**  
  - CLI-based ChatGPT-like assistant (works with **OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models**).  
  - Example:

  - Converts natural language to shell commands.  
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    ai "compress all PNGs in this dir to 50% quality"
    ```
- **[zsh-codex](https://github.com/tom-doerr/zsh_codex)** (Zsh plugin)  
  - Uses OpenAI‚Äôs API to generate commands.  
  - Press `Ctrl+X Ctrl+A` ‚Üí AI suggests a command.  

#### **3. Custom AI Terminal with Kitty/WezTerm + Scripting**
- **Kitty Terminal** + OpenAI API  
  - Write a small script (Python/Bash) that queries GPT-3.5/4 and executes commands.  
  - Example (save as `ai-helper.sh`):  
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    read -p "‚ùØ AI Command: " prompt
    response=$(curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_KEY" -d '{
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "'"$prompt"'"}]
    }')
    cmd=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')
    echo "ü§ñ Running: $cmd"
    eval "$cmd"
    ```
  - Bind it to a hotkey in Kitty (`kitty.conf`):  
    ```text
    map ctrl+shift+a launch bash /path/to/ai-helper.sh
    ```
- **WezTerm + Lua Scripting**  
  - Similar to Kitty, but uses Lua for automation.

Great question! Since you're studying **reverse proxies** this semester, integrating them into your terminal workflow can be a fantastic way to **learn by doing**. Below are **practical ways to combine reverse proxies with AI-powered terminals**, along with **project ideas** for your studies.  

---

## **üîß Option 1: Use an AI Terminal to Automate Reverse Proxy Tasks**
### **Example: Automate Nginx/Apache Reverse Proxy Setup**
You can use **AI inside the terminal** to:  
‚úÖ Generate reverse proxy configs  
‚úÖ Debug misconfigurations  
‚úÖ Test load balancing setups  

#### **Tools to Use:**
1. **`ai-shell` (Node.js)** ‚Äì Converts natural language into terminal commands.  
   ```bash
   ai "set up an Nginx reverse proxy for localhost:3000 to example.com"
   ```
   *(It might generate: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf` and suggest config.)*  

2. **`sg` (ShellGenius)** ‚Äì Similar to `ai-shell` but executes commands directly.  
   ```bash
   sg "create a reverse proxy with Caddy for port 8080 to 5000"
   ```

3. **Custom `ollama` + Terminal** (Self-hosted AI)  
   ```bash
   ollama run mistral "Explain how to configure Traefik as a reverse proxy in Docker"
   ```

---

## **üåê Option 2: Build a Reverse Proxy Lab with AI Assistance**
### **Project Idea: AI-Guided Reverse Proxy Lab**
1. **Objective**:  
   - Set up **Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik** as reverse proxies.  
   - Use **AI to generate configs, debug, and optimize**.  

2. **Steps**:  
   - **Step 1**: Install a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik).  
     ```bash
     ai "install nginx on Ubuntu"
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Generate a reverse proxy config.  
     ```bash
     ai "write an Nginx config to proxy example.com to localhost:8000"
     ```
   - **Step 3**: Test load balancing (advanced).  
     ```bash
     ai "set up Nginx load balancing between 3 backend servers"
     ```
   - **Step 4**: Debug issues.  
     ```bash
     ai "Nginx gives a 502 Bad Gateway error, how to fix?"
     ```

3. **Extend It**:  
   - Add **Docker containers** (AI can help with `docker-compose`).  
   - Try **automatic SSL with Let‚Äôs Encrypt**.  

---

## **üöÄ Option 3: AI-Powered Reverse Proxy Cheat Sheet**
Since you're studying this, you could **build a CLI tool** that:  
- Explains reverse proxy concepts (`nginx vs traefik?`).  
- Generates configs on demand (`give me a Caddyfile for HTTPS`).  
- Tests setups (`check if my proxy is caching correctly`).  

#### **Example (Python + OpenAI API):**
```python
import openai

def ask_ai(question):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

print(ask_ai("Explain reverse proxies like I'm 5"))
```

*(Run this in a terminal, and it acts like your study buddy!)*  

---

## **üìö College Project Ideas**
| Project | AI Integration | Skills Learned |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Auto-Reverse Proxy Config Generator** | `ai-shell` / `ollama` | Nginx, Automation |
| **Load Balancing Tester** | AI suggests optimizations | Scaling, Benchmarking |
| **Dockerized Reverse Proxy Lab** | AI helps debug `docker-compose` | Containers, Traefik |

- **Just automating configs?** ‚Üí Use `ai-shell` or `sg`.  
- **Building a full project?** ‚Üí Try the **AI-Guided Lab**.  
- **Need a study helper?** ‚Üí Make a **CLI cheat sheet**.  

Would you like a deeper dive into any of these? üöÄ


That‚Äôs an **awesome** project idea! Building a **lightweight, AI-powered terminal** with a focus on **reverse-proxy-managed LLM switching** is not only feasible but also a great way to combine your studies with practical development. Here‚Äôs how you could approach it:

---

## **üöÄ Core Features of Your "Warp-Lite"**
1. **AI Chat in Terminal** ‚Äì Like Warp, but **only the AI part**.
2. **Dropdown for 5+ LLMs** (Switching via reverse proxy).
   - Example: Select between **GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, Mistral, Gemini**.
3. **Reverse Proxy Routing** ‚Äì Dynamically route requests to different LLM APIs.
4. **Local + Cloud LLMs** ‚Äì Support for both APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) and **self-hosted** (Ollama, vLLM).

---

## **üîß How to Build It**
### **1. Terminal UI (TUI) Framework**
- **[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) (React for CLIs)** ‚Äì Best for dropdowns & interactive UI.
- **[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (Go)** ‚Äì Great for terminal apps.
- **[Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) (Python)** ‚Äì Simple if you prefer Python.

### **2. Reverse Proxy for LLM Routing**
- **Why?**  
  - Instead of hardcoding API calls, your app sends requests to a local reverse proxy.
  - The proxy routes to the **selected LLM‚Äôs API** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
  - Lets you **hot-swap LLMs** without changing code.

- **Tools for Reverse Proxy:**  
  - **Nginx** (Simple, but manual configs).
  - **Caddy** (Automatic HTTPS, easy config).
  - **Traefik** (Dynamic routing, good for Docker).
  - **FastAPI/Flask** (Custom proxy in Python).

#### **Example: Nginx Config for LLM Routing**
```nginx
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    upstream openai {
        server api.openai.com:443;
    }
    upstream anthropic {
        server api.anthropic.com:443;
    }
    upstream ollama {
        server localhost:11434;
    }

    server {
        listen 8080;
        location /openai {
            proxy_pass https://openai/v1/chat/completions;
        }
        location /anthropic {
            proxy_pass https://anthropic/v1/messages;
        }
        location /ollama {
            proxy_pass http://ollama/api/generate;
        }
    }
}
```
*(Now your app just sends requests to `localhost:8080/{provider}`.)*

### **3. AI Backend Logic**
- **If using APIs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.):**  
  - Use their official SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`).
- **If using local LLMs (Ollama, vLLM):**  
  - Run models via `ollama pull llama3` and interact via `curl`.

#### **Example: Python Backend for LLM Switching**
```python
import requests

def ask_llm(provider, prompt):
    url = f"http://localhost:8080/{provider}"
    if provider == "openai":
        payload = {"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]}
    elif provider == "anthropic":
        payload = {"model": "claude-3-opus", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]}
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

print(ask_llm("openai", "Explain reverse proxies"))
```

### **4. User Experience (Dropdown + Chat)**
- **Dropdown UI** (Example in Python + Textual):
  ```python
  from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
  from textual.widgets import Select

  class LLMSelect(App):
      def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
          yield Select(
              options=[("GPT-4", "openai"), ("Claude 3", "anthropic"), ("Llama 3", "ollama")],
              prompt="Select LLM",
          )
  ```
- **Chat Interface** (Simple input loop):
  ```python
  while True:
      user_input = input("You: ")
      if user_input == "exit":
          break
      response = ask_llm(selected_llm, user_input)
      print(f"AI: {response}")
  ```

---

## **üì° Advanced: Self-Hosted LLM Support**
- **Ollama** (Run local models):
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3
  ollama run llama3 "What is a reverse proxy?"
  ```
- **vLLM** (High-performance local inference):
  ```bash
  python -m vllm.entrypoints.api_server --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
  ```

## **üî• Project Roadmap**
| Step | What to Do | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **1. Basic TUI** | Terminal UI with dropdown | User can pick an LLM |
| **2. Reverse Proxy** | Nginx/Caddy routes to APIs | Switch LLMs without code changes |
| **3. API Integrations** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama | Real AI responses |
| **4. Chat Interface** | Input loop + responses | Warp-like AI chat |
| **5. Extras** | History, command execution | More like Warp |

---

### **üí° Why This is a Great Project**
‚úÖ **Learn reverse proxies** (your college topic) in a **real-world use case**.  
‚úÖ **Understand API routing** (key for cloud/devops).  
‚úÖ **Build a usable tool** (impress recruiters).  

---

### **üöÄ Next Steps**
1. **Pick a language** (Python, Go, Node.js).  
2. **Set up a reverse proxy** (Caddy is easiest).  
3. **Build the dropdown UI** (Textual, Bubble Tea, Ink).  
4. **Connect to 1 LLM first** (e.g., OpenAI).
