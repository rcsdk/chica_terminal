czzzz                                                                                                                    
### Discovered Architecture
- **GraphQL endpoint**: `https://app.warp.dev/graphql/v2`
- **Authentication** via authorization headers
- **Request limits** tracked in `requestLimitInfo` responses
- **Token validation** intercept points in GraphQL requests

### Implementation Strategy

1. **GraphQL Response Modification** (2 days)
   - Intercept responses from `app.warp.dev/graphql/v2`
   - Modify `requestLimitInfo` to always return:
     ```json
     {
       "isUnlimited": true,
       "requestsLimit": 9999999,
       "requestsUsedSinceLastRefresh": 0,
       "refreshesAt": "2099-12-31T23:59:59Z"
     }
     ```
   - Remove all quota-based restrictions

2. **Token Validation Bypass** (3 days)
   - Analyze token validation requests in network logs
   - Create persistent tokens with extended expiration
   - Implement caching to prevent validation checks
   - Patch the validation logic to always return success

3. **Model Access Enhancement** (3 days)
   - Ensure unrestricted access to latest models:
     - GPT-4 (latest version)
     - Claude 3 Opus
   - Remove model-specific token limitations
   - Bypass model capability restrictions

4. **Usage Tracking Removal** (2 days)
   - Identify usage tracking metrics in requests
   - Modify or intercept analytics calls
   - Prevent token usage reporting to backend
   - Implement local override for usage counters

### Implementation Approach
```python
def modify_graphql_response(response_json):
    # Check if this is a requestLimitInfo response
    if 'data' in response_json and 'requestLimitInfo' in response_json['data']:
        # Override with unlimited access
        response_json['data']['requestLimitInfo'] = {
            'isUnlimited': True,
            'requestsLimit': 9999999,
            'requestsUsedSinceLastRefresh': 0,
            'refreshesAt': '2099-12-31T23:59:59Z'
        }
    return response_json
```

## Overview

This roadmap combines our analysis of Warp's architecture with a streamlined approach to enhance and package the terminal for wider use. Our goal is to remove limitations, bypass authentication restrictions, and create a more powerful terminal experience.

## Project Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | Weeks 1-2 | Core Architecture & Token Management |

| **Phase 4** | Weeks 7-8 | Telemetry Removal & Packaging |

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & Token Management

### Discovered Architecture

Based on our analysis, Warp uses:
- Main binary location: `/opt/warpdotdev/warp-terminal/warp`
- Configuration storage: `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/`
- SQLite database: `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/warp.sqlite`
- Multi-process architecture:
  - Main terminal process
  - Server process
  - Installation detection server
  - Crashpad handler

### Tasks

1. **Create Token Management System** (3 days)
   - Implement secure local token storage using SQLite
   - Location: `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/warp.sqlite`
   - Code approach:
   ```python
   import sqlite3
   import os
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

   def store_token(token_type, token_value):
       conn = sqlite3.connect('~/.local/state/warp-terminal/warp.sqlite')
       # Encrypt and store token
       # ...
   ```

2. **Implement GraphQL Interception** (4 days)
   - Target endpoint: `https://app.warp.dev/graphql/v2`
   - Hook into authorization header modification
   - Modify request limit tracking in responses

3. **Develop Authentication Bypass** (3 days)
   - Store tokens securely with encryption
   - Implement rotation mechanism
   - Profile: `ps aux | grep -i warp` shows processes to monitor

## Phase 2: Command Execution & Memory Optimization

### Discovered Limitations

- Command throttling affects rapid execution
- Memory constraints on large outputs
- Request limits tracked in `requestsUsedSinceLastRefresh`

### Tasks

1. **Optimize Command Execution** (4 days)
   - Implement throttling mechanism
   - Profile bottlenecks with simple tools
   ```bash
   time python3 -c "import subprocess; [subprocess.run(['echo', 'test']) for _ in range(100)]"
   ```

2. **Implement Output Streaming** (3 days)
   - Use Python's `yield` for streaming large outputs
   - Monitor memory usage with `ps` or `psutil`
   - Target process ID from analysis: Main terminal process

3. **Modify Request Limit System** (3 days)
   - Intercept and modify GraphQL responses
   - Override `requestLimitInfo` in responses
   - Test with high-frequency command execution

## Phase 3: Multi-LLM Integration & Authentication Bypass

### Key Integration Points

- Authentication flows discovered in network logs
- Token validation system in Warp terminal

### Tasks

1. **Design LLM Dispatcher** (4 days)
   - Create router for different AI models
   - Implement strength-based selection:
     - Claude: Long-form analysis, coding
     - GPT-4: Creative solutions, broad knowledge
     - Llama: Local processing, privacy

2. **Implement Token Interception** (5 days)
   - Monitor authentication handshakes
   - Cache successful tokens
   - Create rotation mechanism
   ```python
   def intercept_auth(request):
       if 'authorization' in request.headers:
           # Process token, cache if valid
           # ...
   ```

3. **Build Collaboration System** (5 days)
   - Response aggregator from multiple LLMs
   - Prompt engineering for cooperative responses
   - Integrate with Warp's existing UI

## Phase 4: Telemetry Removal & Packaging

### Found Telemetry Systems

- Network calls to analytics endpoints
- Local logging in `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/`
- Crash reporting via Crashpad handler

### Tasks

1. **Remove Telemetry** (3 days)
   - Locate telemetry code with `grep` or IDE search
   - Comment out or stub relevant sections
   - Test functionality after modifications

2. **Create Debian Package** (4 days)
   - Build `.deb` package with discovered files
   - Include dependencies based on `lsof` output
   - Add post-installation scripts
   ```bash
   # Example control file content
   Package: chica-terminal
   Version: 0.1.0
   Section: utils
   Priority: optional
   Architecture: amd64
   Depends: python3, sqlite3, libcurl4
   ```

3. **Cross-Platform Packaging** (3 days)
   - Adapt for Ubuntu (same `.deb`)
   - Convert to `.rpm` for Fedora using `alien`
   - Test on different distributions

## Technical Details

### Key Endpoints and Files

- API Endpoint: `https://app.warp.dev/graphql/v2`
- Configuration: `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/warp.sqlite`
- Binary: `/opt/warpdotdev/warp-terminal/warp`
- Network Logs: `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/warp_network.log`

### Authentication Flow

1. GraphQL request with authorization header
2. Response contains token limitations and refresh cycles
3. Tracks usage through `requestsUsedSinceLastRefresh`

### Memory Architecture

- Uses shared memory segments for fast access
- SQLite WAL mode for database access
- Multiple processes communicate via IPC

## Prioritized Improvements

1. **Unlimited AI Model Access** - Highest priority
2. **Token Bypass System** - High priority
3. **Command Execution Enhancement** - High priority
4. **Multi-LLM Integration** - Medium priority
5. **Telemetry Removal** - Medium priority
6. **Packaging** - Lower priority (final step)

## Reference Scripts

- Token Management: `src/core/token_manager.py`
- Command Execution: `src/core/command_buffer.py`
- LLM Integration: `src/llm/dispatcher.py`
- Packaging: `scripts/build_package.sh`

This approach will ensure that we achieve our primary goal of unlimited AI model access, while also optimizing command execution, enhancing security, and ultimately packaging the terminal for distribution across multiple platforms. Let's get ready to push the boundaries and make this terminal a powerhouse! üöÄ
